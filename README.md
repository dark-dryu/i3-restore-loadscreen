# Restore i3 workspaces with load screen

Here I present the method I use to beautify the process of restoring the i3 workspaces that were saved when I closed my last session. I use <a url=https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/i3-resurrect> i3-resurrect </a> to save and restore the windows in workspaces, but I didn't like the continuous spawning of black windows, so I created a script to "cover" this process. I archieved that thanks to <a url=https://github.com/elkowar/eww>eww</a>. 

## Dependencies

i3-resurrect
eww
picom-jonaburg-git (see picom config to get the blur effect)
